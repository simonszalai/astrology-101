# Create Build Todos Command

Create detailed implementation steps (`build_todos/`) from an approved `plan.md`. This command
performs **deep research** into the codebase, knowledge base, and git history to ensure all
existing patterns and rules are discovered and followed.

## Usage

```
/create-build-todos 009                              # Bug/incident #009 (NNN format)
/create-build-todos F001                             # Feature F001 (FNNN format)
/create-build-todos work_items/active/009-fix-timeout  # Use explicit path
```

## Prerequisites

- `plan.md` must exist and be approved (run `/plan` first)
- Review and iterate on plan.md before running this command

## What This Command Does

**Deep research phase:**

1. **Knowledge base search** - Find all relevant:
   - References (architecture, patterns, standards)
   - Gotchas (pitfalls that apply to this change)
   - Solutions (past fixes for similar problems)

2. **Codebase pattern search** - Find all:
   - Similar implementations to follow
   - Conventions specific to affected areas
   - Error handling patterns in use
   - Test patterns for this type of code

3. **Git history analysis** - Understand:
   - Why affected code exists in its current form
   - Past issues with similar changes
   - Recent changes that might conflict
   - Contributors who know this area

**Implementation planning phase:**

4. **Create build_todos/** with detailed steps:
   - Specific files to modify
   - Code examples following discovered patterns
   - Dependencies between steps
   - Test requirements per step
   - Verification commands

## Process

1. **Locate work item:**
   - Same ID resolution as `/plan` command
   - Error if plan.md doesn't exist

2. **Read context:**
   - `plan.md` - The approved architecture plan
   - `source.md` - Original problem/feature description
   - `investigation.md` - Production findings (if exists)

3. **Spawn build-planner agent** for deep research:
   - Agent searches knowledge base exhaustively
   - Agent searches codebase for all relevant patterns
   - Agent analyzes git history for context
   - Agent may spawn additional researcher agents

4. **Write build_todos/**:
   - One file per implementation step
   - Steps ordered by dependencies
   - Each step includes discovered patterns to follow

## Research Depth

The build-planner agent performs thorough research:

| Area           | What It Searches                               | Why                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Knowledge base | All references, gotchas, solutions             | Avoid known pitfalls, follow standards     |
| Codebase       | Similar code, patterns, conventions            | Match existing style and approaches        |
| Git history    | Related commits, past issues, contributor info | Understand context and avoid past mistakes |
| CLAUDE.md      | Project rules and critical requirements        | Ensure compliance with project rules       |

## Output

```
work_items/active/{NNN|FNNN}-title/
  plan.md             # Input (must exist)
  build_todos/        # Created by build-planner
    01-step-name.md
    02-step-name.md
    ...
```

Each build todo contains:

- **Objective** - What this step accomplishes
- **Files to Modify** - Specific files and line estimates
- **Discovered Patterns** - Patterns found that must be followed
- **Implementation Details** - Code snippets following patterns
- **Tests** - Test cases based on similar code
- **Verification** - Commands to verify step worked

## Agent Selection (if build-planner requests)

| Need                     | Agent          | Why                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Deeper pattern search    | `researcher`   | Find more examples in codebase     |
| Framework best practices | `web-searcher` | External docs for complex patterns |

## Next Steps

After build_todos are created:

```
wsc <workitem_folder_name>    # Create worktree and start building
/build F001                   # Execute build in current session
```
