# Review Command

Review implementation by spawning specialized review agents in parallel.

## Usage

```
/review 009                              # Bug/incident #009 (NNN format)
/review F001                             # Feature F001 (FNNN format)
/review work_items/active/009-fix-timeout  # Use explicit path
```

## Agent Dispatch

Spawn these agents **in parallel** (single message, multiple Task tool calls):

| Agent           | Skills                                                            | Focus                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| reviewer-code   | review-typescript-standards, review-simplicity, review-patterns   | Code quality, YAGNI, design patterns |
| reviewer-system | review-architecture, review-security, review-performance          | Architecture, security, performance  |

**Conditional agent** (based on file changes):

| Condition                        | Agent         | Skills                                                      |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Database/model/migration changes | reviewer-data | review-data-integrity, review-migrations, review-deployment |

## Process

1. **Gather context:**
   - Read `plan.md` for intended approach
   - Run `git diff --name-only` to identify changed files
   - Read `build_todos/` completion notes

2. **Check existing review_todos:**
   - List files in `review_todos/` directory (if it exists)
   - Extract index numbers from filenames (pattern: `NN-*.md`)
   - Find the highest existing index number
   - New findings start at `max_index + 1` (or 01 if empty)

3. **Spawn agents** with prompts like:

   ```
   Review these files for [focus area]: [file list]
   Context: [brief summary of what was implemented]
   Return findings with file_path:line_number format.
   ```

4. **Collect findings** into `review_todos/` directory
   - Use `review` skill template for output format
   - Number files starting from the next available index (from step 2)

5. **Update plan.md** work log:
   ```
   | YYYY-MM-DD | review | Ran review agents | N findings (X p1, Y p2, Z p3) |
   ```

## Output

See `review` skill for:

- Priority levels (p1, p2, p3)
- Review todo template (`review/templates/review-todo.md`)
- Synthesis methodology
