# Investigation: [Bug/Incident Title]

> **Scope:** This document diagnoses the problem (root cause analysis). Solution design happens
> in `plan.md` after investigation is complete.

## Summary

[1-3 sentence overview of findings. What broke, when, and what was the impact?]

---

## Evidence

### Database (investigator-postgres)

[Findings from database queries, health checks]

- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2

### Codebase (researcher)

[Findings from code analysis, git history, knowledge base]

- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2

## Root Causes

| #   | Root Cause | Severity | Evidence | Impact          |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------------- |
| 1   | [Name]     | CRITICAL | [Proof]  | [What it broke] |
| 2   | [Name]     | HIGH     | [Proof]  | [What it broke] |

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. [Root Cause Name]

**Location:** [File path, service, or component]
**Trigger:** [What causes this issue]
**Evidence:**

```
[Relevant logs, code, or metrics]
```

**Timeline:**

- [Timestamp]: [Event]
- [Timestamp]: [Event]

### 2. [Root Cause Name]

**Location:** [File path, service, or component]
**Trigger:** [What causes this issue]
**Evidence:**

```
[Relevant logs, code, or metrics]
```

## Recommended Fix Directions

> **Note:** These are high-level directions based on root cause analysis. Detailed solution
> design (architecture, tradeoffs, verification) happens in `/plan`.

### Priority 1: Critical

1. **[Fix direction]**
   - Root cause addressed: [Which root cause this fixes]
   - General approach: [High-level what needs to change]
   - Risk: [Low/Medium/High]

### Priority 2: High

1. **[Fix direction]**
   - Root cause addressed: [Which root cause this fixes]
   - General approach: [High-level what needs to change]
   - Risk: [Low/Medium/High]

### Priority 3: Medium

1. **[Fix direction]**
   - Root cause addressed: [Which root cause this fixes]
   - General approach: [High-level what needs to change]
   - Risk: [Low/Medium/High]

## Next Steps

After investigation is complete, run `/plan {id}` to design the solution.

- [ ] Review root causes with stakeholders
- [ ] Run `/plan` to create architecture plan
- [ ] [Additional action items if needed]
