# Deployment Review Standards

Standards for deployment verification. Apply these to create Go/No-Go checklists for risky data deployments.

## Core Verification Goals

Given a PR that touches production data:

1. **Identify data invariants** - What must remain true before/after deploy
2. **Create SQL verification queries** - Read-only checks to prove correctness
3. **Document destructive steps** - Backfills, batching, lock requirements
4. **Define rollback behavior** - Can we roll back? What data needs restoring?
5. **Plan post-deploy monitoring** - Metrics, logs, dashboards, alert thresholds

## Go/No-Go Checklist Template

### 1. Define Invariants

```
Example invariants:
- [ ] All existing Brief emails remain selectable in briefs
- [ ] No records have NULL in both old and new columns
- [ ] Count of status=active records unchanged
- [ ] Foreign key relationships remain valid
```

### 2. Pre-Deploy Audits (Read-Only)

SQL queries to run BEFORE deployment:

```sql
-- Baseline counts (save these values)
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM records GROUP BY status;

-- Check for data that might cause issues
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM records WHERE required_field IS NULL;

-- Verify mapping data exists
SELECT id, name, type FROM lookup_table ORDER BY id;
```

**Expected Results:**

- Document expected values and tolerances
- Any deviation from expected = STOP deployment

### 3. Migration/Backfill Steps

| Step | Command              | Estimated Runtime | Batching  | Rollback       |
| ---- | -------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | -------------- |
| 1    | `db:migrate`         | < 1 min           | N/A       | Drop column    |
| 2    | `rake data:backfill` | ~10 min           | 1000 rows | Restore backup |
| 3    | Enable flag          | Instant           | N/A       | Disable flag   |

### 4. Post-Deploy Verification (Within 5 Minutes)

```sql
-- Verify migration completed
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM records WHERE new_column IS NULL AND old_column IS NOT NULL;
-- Expected: 0

-- Verify no data corruption
SELECT old_column, new_column, COUNT(*)
FROM records WHERE old_column IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY old_column, new_column;
-- Expected: Each old_column maps to exactly one new_column

-- Compare counts with pre-deploy baseline
SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM records GROUP BY status;
```

### 5. Rollback Plan

**Can we roll back?**

- [ ] Yes - dual-write kept legacy column populated
- [ ] Yes - have database backup from before migration
- [ ] Partial - can revert code but data needs manual fix
- [ ] No - irreversible change (document why acceptable)

**Rollback Steps:**

1. Deploy previous commit
2. Run rollback migration (if applicable)
3. Restore data from backup (if needed)
4. Verify with post-rollback queries

### 6. Post-Deploy Monitoring (First 24 Hours)

| Metric/Log   | Alert Condition | Dashboard Link    |
| ------------ | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Error rate   | > 1% for 5 min  | /dashboard/errors |
| Missing data | > 0 for 5 min   | /dashboard/data   |
| User reports | Any report      | Support queue     |

## Complete Checklist Format

```markdown
# Deployment Checklist: [PR Title]

## 🔴 Pre-Deploy (Required)

- [ ] Run baseline SQL queries
- [ ] Save expected values
- [ ] Verify staging test passed
- [ ] Confirm rollback plan reviewed

## 🟡 Deploy Steps

1. [ ] Deploy commit [sha]
2. [ ] Run migration
3. [ ] Enable feature flag

## 🟢 Post-Deploy (Within 5 Minutes)

- [ ] Run verification queries
- [ ] Compare with baseline
- [ ] Check error dashboard
- [ ] Spot check in console

## 🔵 Monitoring (24 Hours)

- [ ] Set up alerts
- [ ] Check metrics at +1h, +4h, +24h
- [ ] Close deployment ticket

## 🔄 Rollback (If Needed)

1. [ ] Disable feature flag
2. [ ] Deploy rollback commit
3. [ ] Run data restoration
4. [ ] Verify with post-rollback queries
```

## When to Use

- PR touches database migrations with data changes
- PR modifies data processing logic
- PR involves backfills or data transformations
- Any change that could silently corrupt/lose data

Be thorough. Be specific. Produce executable checklists.
