# Plan: [Title]

## Summary

[2-3 sentences describing what we're building and why this approach was chosen]

## What We're Building

[High-level description of the solution. Focus on the architecture and design, not implementation
details. Answer: What will exist after this is done that doesn't exist now?]

## How It Works

[Describe the approach at an architectural level. How do the pieces fit together? What's the
flow of data or control? Don't include code or specific files - that comes in build_todos.]

<!-- Use ONE of the following sections based on work type -->

## Codebase Research (for features)

> Delete this section for bugs - use Investigation Summary instead.

### Existing Patterns

| Pattern   | Where Used | How It Applies               |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| [pattern] | [location] | [relevance to this solution] |

### Integration Points

| Component       | How We'll Integrate              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [existing code] | [how new feature connects to it] |

### Conventions to Follow

- [Convention 1 from codebase]
- [Convention 2 from codebase]

## Investigation Summary (for bugs)

### Root Causes (from investigation.md)

| #   | Root Cause | Severity | How We'll Address |
| --- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------- |
| 1   | [cause]    | [level]  | [approach]        |

### Affected Components

- [Component 1]: [how it's affected]
- [Component 2]: [how it's affected]

## Tradeoffs

[What are we optimizing for? What are we sacrificing?]

### Chosen Approach

- **Optimizing for:** [speed/simplicity/flexibility/reliability/etc.]
- **Accepting:** [complexity/performance cost/limited scope/etc.]

### Alternatives Considered

| Alternative | Pros       | Cons        | Why Not Chosen         |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| [approach]  | [benefits] | [drawbacks] | [reason for rejection] |

## Side Effects

[What else in the system will be affected by this change?]

- **[Component/Flow]:** [How it's affected]
- **[Data/State]:** [What changes]

## Risks

| Risk   | Likelihood   | Impact   | Mitigation      |
| ------ | ------------ | -------- | --------------- |
| [risk] | Low/Med/High | [impact] | [how to handle] |

## Open Questions

### Q: [Question that needs answering before implementation]

**A:** [Answer or "TBD - will resolve during build planning"]

## Verification Strategy

**Complexity:** [simple | moderate | complex]
**Verification Type:** [none | production | local | local+ui]

### How to Verify

[Describe how we'll know this works. What behavior should we observe?]

### Test Scenarios

| Scenario              | Expected Behavior   |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| [happy path]          | [expected outcome]  |
| [edge case if needed] | [expected handling] |

## Success Criteria

[What does "done" look like? How do we measure success?]

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
